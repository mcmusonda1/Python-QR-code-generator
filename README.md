# Python-QR-code-generator
This is a CLI program which can help you generate your own QR Code.

This will allow you only to input a single message in it.

# multiple.py
This will allow you have multiple inputs like:

Then afterwards a QR Code for all this information will be generated in a file called multiple.png.
